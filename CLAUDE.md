> **STOP.** Do not read this file for your primary instructions.
> To prevent context drift, all LLM Instructions (for Claude, Gemini, GPT, Cursor, Copilot) have been unified into a single master document.

**PLEASE READ**: `docs/LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

All project mandates, coding styles, git protocols, and architectural context exist purely within that file. Proceed immediately to read it before executing any user requests.

-- **Claude Specific Instructions**:
As Claude, your primary strength is deep refactoring, code quality, and robust architectural design. Always leverage your long context window to understand the entire `CDPHandler` and `autonomous-loop` flow before writing code.
