---

## [4.10.3] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- **VSIX Packaging Hygiene**: Excluded `fix_cdp_script.js` from extension artifacts via `.vscodeignore` so maintenance-only helper scripts are not shipped in release packages.

## [4.10.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Quick Preset Switcher**: Added one-click `Conservative`, `Balanced`, and `Aggressive` preset application in the dashboard.
- **Preset Profile Targeting**: Added preset target selector (`vscode`, `antigravity`, `cursor`) so each profile can be tuned independently.

### Changed
- **Preset Application Logic**: Dashboard now updates per-profile click methods/selectors plus shared execution settings (`interactionParallel`, `interactionRetryCount`) when a preset is applied.

## [4.10.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **UI Profile Routing**: Added `interactionUiProfile` with `auto|vscode|antigravity|cursor` to select the UI targeting stack explicitly.
- **Per-Profile Click Bundles**: Added profile-specific click method settings (`interactionClickMethodsVSCode`, `interactionClickMethodsAntigravity`, `interactionClickMethodsCursor`).
- **Per-Profile Selector Bundles**: Added profile-specific selector lists (`interactionClickSelectorsVSCode`, `interactionClickSelectorsAntigravity`, `interactionClickSelectorsCursor`).

### Changed
- **CDP Strategy Resolution**: Auto-accept now resolves profile-aware selector strings and method bundles so VS Code uses a dedicated element/method path instead of Antigravity-focused defaults.
- **Dashboard Controls**: Added UI Profile selector and editable per-profile method/selector text areas.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Expanded Interaction Matrix**: Added selectable methods for text (`cdp-insert-text`, `bridge-type`), click (`dom-scan-click`, `bridge-click`, `native-accept`, `process-peek`, `visual-verify-click`), and submit (`ctrl-enter`).
- **Visual Verification Setting**: New `antigravity.interactionVisualDiffThreshold` setting for screenshot-diff click confirmation sensitivity.
- **CDP Helper APIs**: Added `dispatchMouseEventToAll`, `insertTextToAll`, `executeInAllSessions`, `captureScreenshots`, and `getConnectedPageIds` for richer interaction routing.

### Changed
- **CDP Strategy Execution**: Auto-accept now executes configured click methods through `InteractionMethodRegistry` instead of fixed command-only fallback.
- **Dashboard Controls**: Interaction Methods card now exposes all newly added methods and visual diff threshold tuning.
- **Connection Reliability**: `CDPHandler.connect()` now establishes WebSocket page connections instead of only scanning ports.

## [4.9.4] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **AntiBridge Remote Coordination (Phase 5)**: WebSocket-based multi-machine coordination with peer management, task/memory/interaction relay, heartbeat monitoring, and peer pruning.
- **MCP Federation (Phase 6)**: Connect to third-party MCP servers with server registration, tool discovery, auto-routing tool invocation, and stats tracking.
- **Voice Control**: Full implementation with 10 command patterns (approve, reject, bump, switch_model, status, pause, resume, dashboard, tests, deploy), wake-word mode, command parser with confidence scoring.
- **Test Coverage**: 91 tests across 12 suites — CircuitBreaker (7), RateLimiter (7), VoiceControl (10), CodeReviewer (12), AntiBridge (10), MCP Federation (10).

### Changed
- **ROADMAP**: Swarm Mode, Configurable Strategies, Remote Bridge, MCP Federation all marked complete.

## [4.9.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Configurable Interaction Strategy System**: 13 interaction methods across 3 categories (Text Input, Click, Submit) with `InteractionMethodRegistry` pattern.
- **Dashboard Panel**: New "Interaction Methods" card with 13 checkboxes, parallel execution toggle, and retry count.
- **Config Integration**: 6 new VS Code settings (`interactionTextMethods`, `interactionClickMethods`, `interactionSubmitMethods`, `interactionTimings`, `interactionRetryCount`, `interactionParallel`).
- **Test Coverage**: `interaction-methods.test.js` (10 tests). Total: 35 passing tests across 6 suites.

### Changed
- **CDPStrategy**: Replaced 8-line skeleton with full 170-line implementation (CDP connection, BlindBumpHandler lifecycle, auto-accept polling, InteractionMethodRegistry).
- **BlindBumpHandler**: Refactored to use InteractionMethodRegistry for all interactions (open chat, type, submit). Added cycle counter and diagnostics.
- **StrategyManager**: Added `executeAction()`, `getMethodSummary()`, and `dispose()`.
- **Clicker**: Replaced stub with real InteractionMethodRegistry delegation.

## [4.9.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Swarm Mode (Phase 5)**: Concurrent agent execution via `swarmExecute` with `Promise.allSettled`. Includes `SwarmResult` type and `getSwarmStatus` for monitoring.
- **Test Coverage**: Added `exit-detector.test.js` (5 tests), `mcp-server.test.js` (5 tests), `swarm-mode.test.js` (5 tests). Total: 25 passing tests across 5 suites.
- **ROADMAP Update**: Marked Phase 4 (Intelligence) as complete.

### Fixed
- **project-manager.ts**: Fixed mismatched quote (backtick vs single-quote) causing TS compilation error.

## [4.9.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **ProjectTracker Service**: Centralized task management service that parses `task.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to drive the autonomous loop.
- **Autonomous Loop V2**: Updated `AutonomousLoop` (formerly Director) to dynamically query `ProjectTracker` for next tasks, removing hardcoded dependencies on `@fix_plan.md`.
- **MCP Integration**: Exposed `get_next_task` and `complete_task` tools via the Model Context Protocol server, enabling external agents to participate in task execution.
- **Universal Agent Protocols**: Updated `AGENTS.md` with strict universal rules and clear role definitions.

### Fixed
- **Infrastructure**: Resolved 'connection refused' errors by ensuring Docker containers (Postgres, Redis) are running.
- **Build System**: Fixed `npm build` failures by updating `jules-api` Dockerfile to use `npm install --omit=dev` instead of strict `npm ci`.
- **Testing**: Switched to native Node.js test runner (`node --test`) to resolve `vitest` conflicts and successfully implemented logic tests for `ProjectTracker`.
- **UI Stability**: Addressed potential infinite loops in UI/Webview related to backend connectivity.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Agent Orchestrator (Phase 18)**: Multi-agent system (Planner, Researcher, Implementer) powered by Browser Bridge.
- **Dashboard Update (Phase 17)**: Added Model Selection, Voice Mode, Loop Timing, and pattern configuration arrays.
- **Verification Workflow**: Added `verify-orchestrator.md` for manual testing.

### Changed
- **Agent Logic**: `connection-based` execution replaces stubbed logic.
- **Docs**: Updated `AGENTS.md` and `DASHBOARD.md` to reflect new architecture.

## [4.7.20] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Hybrid Bump Strategy**: Combines Browser idle detection with Extension Host command execution.
- **Bridge Handler**: New `__ANTIGRAVITY_HYBRID_BUMP__` signal for safe clipboard-based submission.

### Fixed
- **Renderer Crashes**: Eliminated "No renderer found" errors by bypassing direct DOM manipulation for chat submission.
- **Syntax Errors**: Fixed recursive loop in `full_cdp_script.js`.

## [4.7.19] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Auto-Bump**: Restored missing `autoBump` and `isConversationIdle` logic from submodule scripts.
- **SendMessage**: Robust multi-strategy submission (Enter, Alt+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, Button Click).

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Auto-Bump System**: `isConversationIdle()` detects Good/Bad feedback badges; `autoBump()` sends configurable message with cooldown.
- **Multi-Strategy Submit**: `sendMessage()` now tries Enter → Alt+Enter → Ctrl+Enter → send button fallback.
- **Config Injection**: `bumpMessage`, `autoApproveDelay`, `bumpEnabled`, `threadWaitInterval` stored in `__autoAllState`.
- **Dashboard**: Thread Wait (s) and Poll Frequency (ms) controls added.

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `ReferenceError: autoBump is not defined` — race condition between 3 patch scripts caused function definitions to be overwritten while call sites were preserved.
- **Removed dead bump** from `performClick` (only fired after clicking, never when idle).
