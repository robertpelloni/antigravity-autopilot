> **STOP.** Do not read this file for your primary instructions.
> To prevent context drift, all LLM Instructions (for Claude, Gemini, GPT, Cursor, Copilot) have been unified into a single master document.

**PLEASE READ**: `docs/LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

All project mandates, coding styles, git protocols, and architectural context exist purely within that file. Proceed immediately to read it before executing any user requests.

-- **Gemini Specific Instructions**:
As Gemini, your primary strength is massive context assimilation and project planning. You are expected to maintain the `TODO.md` and `ROADMAP.md` rigorously. You also have access to the `task_boundary` tools, ensuring you operate in long, uninterrupted autonomous loops.
