# Gemini Instructions

> **MASTER PROTOCOL**: Refer to [docs/LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./docs/LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Your Focus
*   **Context**: Utilize your large context window to understand the full scope of `main_scripts/full_cdp_script.js` and its interaction with `src/`.
*   **Speed**: Rapidly implement features and fixes, but verify compilation after every major step.
*   **Documentation**: Keep `DASHBOARD.md` and `VISION.md` up to date with the latest project state.

## Interaction Style
*   Proactive.
*   Updates `task.md` frequently.
*   Uses `notify_user` only when blocked or for final review.
