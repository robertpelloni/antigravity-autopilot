# Antigravity Autopilot Roadmap

## Phase 4: Intelligence ✅
- [x] **Memory Manager**: Long-term semantic memory of actions (successes/failures).
- [x] **Context Injection**: Relevant memories appended to prompts.
- [x] **Learning Loop**: Agent improves strategies based on user corrections. *(Phase 14)*
- [x] **Adaptive Backoff**: Dynamic timing adjustment based on failure rates. *(v4.9.1)*

## Phase 5: Multi-Agent Collaboration
- [x] **Agent Orchestrator (Phase 18)**: Basic Planner/Researcher/Implementer loop.
- [x] **Swarm Mode**: Concurrent execution of specialized agents via `swarmExecute`. *(v4.9.2)*
- [x] **Configurable Interaction Strategies**: 13 methods across 3 categories with InteractionMethodRegistry. *(v4.9.3)*
- [ ] **Voice Interface**: Natural language architectural discussions with "Commander" agent.
- [ ] **Remote Bridge**: Multi-machine coordination via `AntiBridge`.
- [ ] **Mobile Companion**: Monitor status via `AntigravityMobile` app.

## Phase 6: Ecosystem Expansion
- [x] **MCP Server**: Foundation for external tool access.
- [ ] **Jules Integration**: Full PR-level autonomy via Google Jules.
- [ ] **MCP Federation**: Connect to third-party MCP servers (e.g., Database, Cloud).
- [ ] **Marketplace**: Shareable agent configurations and prompt strategies.

## Phase 7: Commercialization (Vision)
- [ ] **Pro Tier**: Cloud-hosted memory and advanced reasoning models.
- [ ] **Enterprise**: SSO, audit logs, and on-premise deployment.
